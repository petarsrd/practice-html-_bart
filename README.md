# practice-html-_bart

This is the first project I did in BIT bootcamp. The goal was to create a basic static website using HTML only. 

HTML was used both for the structure and layout (which, despite considered to be a bad practice nowadays, proved
to be rather useful for practicing HTML). During the project I solidified my knowledge of the most used HTML tags, 
as well as the knowledge of HTML tables, forms and iframes.
